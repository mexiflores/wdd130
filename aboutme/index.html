  <h2>Mexico Bernardo Flores</h2>
  <h2>Mexi</h2>
  <p>You read correctly! My first name is really Mexico, but everyone calls me Mexi. I'm orginally from Veracruz, Mexico
    I currenlty live in Orem, Utah. I working on my Bachelors degree in Applied Technologies, I have 3 beautiful
    children my oldest is 12 years old, and I have 2 little girls 7 and 6 years old. I work for an awesome software
    company here in Lehi, UT currently in their Sales & Marketing Team trying to change departments to their engineering
    side of the house. I love playing all types of sports, hiking, working out, latin dancing, I'm a big closet as well.
    I served a mission in Ft. Lauderdale, FL currently serve as the Priest Quorum Advisor. Excited to work and get to
    know all of you, web development is still something new for me I've done some Java bootcamps in the past, but never
    got too far hence why I'm here. </p>

  <p>I'm forever gratful for my Heavenly Father and his son Jesus Christ for what they have both done in my life.
    They're moments of sorrow and lonely, but I can't deny I was never left alont to figure it out on my own. The gospel
    of Jesus Christ has been my light when things didn't seem like it was going to end well, but here I am in the
    journey of discipleship.</p>
